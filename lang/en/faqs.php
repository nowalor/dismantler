        You can either read this part number on your defective part or possibly ask your workshop. 
        You can always see the chassis number of the donor vehicle for the spare part in our offer. 
        Using this chassis number, you can check the compatibility with your workshop.
        In case of doubt, you can contact us with your chassis number and the 
        Currus-Connect ID of the spare part you found, and we will try to assist you. 
        Keep in mind, return costs for spare parts that do not fit are your responsibility!',
